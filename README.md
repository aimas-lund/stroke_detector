# Passive Stroke Detector

Project Description Passively monitoring a smartphone user, using the front camera, to check whether a stroke is occurring. This will be done by passively checking for facial drooping, which is when one side of the face drops down, compared to the opposite side. When one/multiple positive samples occur, the app will recommend further tests to be performed. The app will then evaluate based on the results, if the user should do an emergency call. This is useful, given time is an important factor for preventing permanent brain damage or death. Moreover, 75% of all cases of stroke are experienced by people who have not experienced stroke before. This means that peopleâ€™s ability to self-diagnose is poor. This app will help with the self-diagnosis, and improve response time.
